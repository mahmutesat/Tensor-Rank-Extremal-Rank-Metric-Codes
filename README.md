# Tensor-Rank-Extremal-Rank-Metric-Codes
This library is constructed for the PURE Project in Summer 2020.
The file "Library.txt" contains every function that you can use for the project. However, we divided it into small parts for specific usage.
Please note that no matter which specific file you are going to use, please use the file "CommonFunctions.txt" beforehand.

In order to calculate Slice Spaces, it is sufficient to use the file "CalculationOfSliceSpaces.txt".
In order to generate the Cauchy Code or to find the image of the function \phi, it is sufficient to use the file "CauchyCodesAndTheFunctionPhi.txt".
In order to calculate generalized tensor ranks, it is sufficient to use the file "GeneralizedTensorRanks.txt".

You can contact me in GitHub if you have any questions.
